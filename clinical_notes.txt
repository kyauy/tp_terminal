Patient 1 was the first spontaneous pregnancy of the family. Ultrasonography at 10 weeksâ€™ gestation (WG) was normal, with nuchal translucency 2.9 mm and crown-lump distance 54.5 mm. The pregnancy was marked by the discovery at 21 WG of several malformations: ventricular septal defect, restricted hand movements with overlapping fingers, and equinovarus position of feet. In addition, facial features and possible bilateral radioulnar synostosis were observed. In utero CT-scan confirmed the bilateral radioulnar synostosis (Figure 1b), and facial reconstruction revealed a large and prominent forehead with large and depressed nasal root, hypoplasia of nasal bones, small and low-set ears, and long and prominent philtrum.
The patient was born at 38 + 2 WG by scheduled caesarean section. Birth measurements were in the normal range [occipital frontal circumference (OFC) 36.5 cm (+1.3 SD); birth weight (BW) 3200 g (-0.6 SD); birth length (BL) not determined]. In addition to prenatal findings, neonatal clinical features included club feet and clenched hands, arachnodactyly with overlapping fingers, bilateral hip dislocation, and global hypotonia. The infant also presented the facial features dolichocephaly and brachycephaly, midface hypoplasia, and ocular proptosis (Figure 2a).
The postnatal course was marked by the appearance at age 3 months of hydrocephaly due to Dandy-Walker malformation. Neonatal skeletal X-rays showed bilateral radioulnar synostosis and fractures of the left tibia and fibula. Neither craniofacial postnatal CT-scan nor additional skeletal X-rays were performed. The patient died at age 5 months due to neurological and respiratory distress.
